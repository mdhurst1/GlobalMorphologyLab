    "* Learn how to make basic calculations that help us understand the changing morphology of the Earth\n",

    "* Be able to explain why the Earth's overall shape is an oblate spheroid\n",

It allows us to build a document with descriptive text, equations, and images etc. while also having the ability to do some calculations as we go along. It's a bit like embedding some Microsoft Excel calculations into a Microsoft Word document! Thus you will find (and use) blocks of computer code (the formula bar in Excel is a simple form of computer programming!). In this case the computer code we will use is a particular programming language called Python. Below is an example block of code that prints a sequence of characters (often called a \"string\") onto the screen."

    "We have explained in the lecture that the Earth is an oblate spheroid in shape (not quite a sphere) due to the centrifugal force of the planet spinning. Let's do some calculations to explore that. Borrowing from physics, we can state that an object at the Earth surface is acted upon by three forces, a gravitational force $F_g$; a \"normal\" force $F_N$ from the ground pushing the object up , and, at the equator, a centrifugual force $F_{cf}$ [all in units of Newtons]. We are going to ignore $F_N$ since for our calculations it is so small it can be considered negligble. \n",

    "Let start with centrifugal force ($F_{cf}$), which is a function of:\n",
    "* the mass of the object $m$ [in units of kg], \n",
    "* the angular rotational velocity of Earth $\\omega$, the greek letter omega; [in units of \"per second\"; or 1/s, which can also be written as s$^{-1}$]; and \n",

    "## Exercise 3: Denudation and Isostasy\n",
    "Recall from our key concepts lecture that we defined denudation: the loss of mass from the Earth surface due to surface processes, acting to reduce the topography. Thus, denudation combines physical erosion and the loss of the residual products of chemical weathering transported in solution by water. In tectonically active regions, denudation tends to be dominated by physical erosion, but in warm and wet climates, and particularly in tectonically quiescient areas, chemical weathering may contribute substantially to denudation losses.\n",

    "Regardless, we can expect that the net result of denudation is that the thickness of the continental crust decreases. What does this mean for isostasy? The loss of mass from the continental crust will result in some sort of isostatic compensation in order to retain gravitational equilibrium.\n",

    "The calculations above consider the simple case that 1 km of material is eroded uniformly from the landscape. In reality, as we will learn in future lectures, denudation tends to be initially focused along water courses, resulting in cutting of river valleys bound by hillslopes, and an increase in landscape relief (a measure of the range of elevations within a specified area). Your final task is to consider how an uneven distribution of erosion might affect isostatic uplift, and what this means for the mountain range. Consider the diagram below:\n",
